    <h1>Cabernet Sauvignon</h1>
    <p>A noble grape variety, Cabernet Sauvignon grows well in humid regions. It became famous as one of the red wines of Médoc, in Bordeaux. In the present day, it is grown in California, Washington, Italy, Australia, Chile, and Argentina etc</p>
    <p>Despite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation—the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects—and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character of the variety. Familiarity and ease of pronunciation have helped to sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even when from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a "colonizer" that takes over wine regions at the expense of native grape varieties</p></div>
